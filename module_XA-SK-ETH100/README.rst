The Ethernet Slice Card provides 100Mbps Ethernet connectivity to sliceKIT. Combined with Ethernet xSOFTip, it allows XCORE multicore microcontrollers to be used in any embedded Ethernet system. You might want a TCP stack and webserver in your system, or maybe you need to provide highly responsive, low latency command and control over UDP, or even you own custom protocol.  You might even want two Ethernet ports - XCORE gives you the flexibility to do it.   HELLO POSSIBILITY!

Features
--------

   * 10/100Mb Ethernet phy 
   * RJ45 connector (cable not included)
   * MII interface to xCORE

Standalone Demo
---------------
The standalone demo for this slice card allows you to use xSOFTip to run a webserver on your xCORE multicore microcontroller. Using the TCP/IP and Webserver xSOFTip you can quicly extend this to provide Ethernet connectivity for any application.
