L2 Slicekit Core Board
======================

This board contains the XMOS device plus support circuitry to form the core of the system.

A single L2 device is be present which has all of its IO connected to the Slots. Additional Slicekit Core Boards can be connected to the Square Slot to add extra processing capability and IO through extra Slice Cards.

For debugging, an XSYS adaptor board is connected to the Chain Connector to allow connection of an XTAG2 to provide a debug link from a USB host.

The Slicekit Core Board is powered by a 12V external power supply.

The following sections describe the features of the Slicekit Core Board.

Power
+++++

Power input to the Slicekit Core Board is via a standard barrel jack connector. A standard 12V external power supply should be used to power the board. Each Sliekit Core Board requires its own +12V supply.

The input supply is used to generate the main +5V board supply via a DC-DC converter.

The main +5V board supply is then fed to all the Slot connectors as well as powering the Slicekit Core Board itself. 3V3 and 1V0 supplies will be generated by DC-DC converters from the 5V main supply. 

The supplies are sequenced to ensure the power up sequence will be 5V then 3V3 then 1V0. When the 1V0 supply is good then the system will be released from reset.

The Slicekit Core Board will provide 3V3 and 5V at 0.25A each for a total of approx 2W per slice.

Debug
+++++

Debug of the system will be via the XSYS adapter board connected to the Chain Connector.

The JTAG signals will be connected as shown in Figure 1. 

Presence detect signals are present on both the Chain Connector and Square Slot connectors to allow detection of a connected board and subsequent automatic switching of the JTAG chain. 

In a system of multiple Slicekit Core Boards, the master will be the source of the JTAG chain so the system can only be debugged from the master. Other boards will see no devices in the JTAG chain.

The use of XScope is covered in the XMOS Links section. The XScope XMOS Link can be either enabled or disabled via a switch on the XTAG2 adapter board.

L2 Boot
+++++++

Master Slicekit Core Boards will boot from SPI flash. Slave Core Boards will boot from XLB from the next connected Core Board. 

To allow re-use of the SPI boot pins as signal IO pins, a latched bus switch is used which connects the XCore SPI pins to either the SPI Flash or to the Slice Card Slots.

The switch is controlled by X0D42 and X0D43 (P8D6 and P8D7 on Tile 0). Once the device has booted X0D43 is used to enable or disable the SPI interface, X0D42 should then transistion from low to high to latch the selection.

The SPI selection state is then maintained until the system is reset.

The XTAG2 system can use the boot mode select signal to force all devices in the chain (master and slave Core Boards) to boot from JTAG (don't boot) for debug purposes. 
If not in this mode, the devices will boot from SPI or XMOS Link as appropriate.

XMOS Links
++++++++++

The Chain Connector contains two 5-bit XMOS Links, XLA and XLB, which can be used for chaining Slicekit Core Boards together. The links from Tile 0 are connected to the Chain Connector and the Star Slot. 
The links from Tile 1 are connected to the Square Slot. 

The only complication in this system is use of the XScope 2-bit XMOS Link. This link overlaps a 4 bit port on the Star Slot connector so it would not be possible to use this for user IO at the same time as XScope. 
To work around this, a switch is present on the XTAG2 adapter board to either enable or disable the XScope XMOS Link. 
When disabled, these pins are disconnected from anything on the Chain Connector and are free for use on the Star Slot. When enabled they will work as an XMOS link and hence will appear on the relevant pins of the Star Slot. 

It is therefore recommended that if a Slice Card is used in the Star Slot the XScope switch is off to ensure correct operation of the Slice Card.

Reset
+++++

The whole system is held in reset until all power supplies are stable. This system reset is connected to all Slice Cards so any circuitry on them can be reset. 
It also indicates to the Slice Cards that their power input is stable.

The reset from the XTAG2 resets the whole system if required for debugging.

Clocking
++++++++

There are two sources for the system clock: an on-board 25MHz oscillator or the CLK signal from the Chain Connector. The system clock source is selected automatically.

This means the system clock from the master Core Board will be fed to all of the slave Core Boards so the whole system will operate synchronously.

The system clock is also fed to each of the Slice Cards.

Testpoints
++++++++++

Each xCore IO signal is also available on a 0.1" header, next to the Slot that it is connected to. 
These connections can be used to connect an oscilloscope or logic analyser, or for interconnection of signals for advanced development work.

The signals are identified on the silkscreen layer of the Slicekit Core Board, the table below lists their relationship to the internal ports.

Slot pinouts
++++++++++++

The signal assignments for the connectors on the Core Board and Slice Cardss can be seen in the table below.

[TODO pinout table] 


Slot signal notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On all Slots, TDO is always out of the Slicekit Core Board, TDI is always in to the Core Board.

MSEL, TCK, TMS, RST_N are all inputs to the core board from the Chain Connecotr and outputs from the Core Board on the Square Slot .
DEBUG is bidirectional.

PRSNT is used on the Chain Connector to detect it is plugged into the Square Slot of another Core Board. This signal is used to switch JTAG and CLK sources.
Similarly, PRSNT_N is used on the Star Slot to detect another Core Board is connected. This signal is used to switch the JTAG chain signals.
 
CLK and RST_N are inputs to the Core Board from the Chain Connector and output from all Slots.
