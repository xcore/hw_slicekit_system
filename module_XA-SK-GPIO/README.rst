The GPIO Slice Card provides a collection of features to sliceKIT including LEDs, buttons and A/D inputs. Combined with xSOFTip it allows simple input/output functions to be evaluated easily, and provides I/O expansion to connect your sliceKIT to other systems. The quick start guide will help you get up and running with sliceKIT in seconds.

--------

   * 4 LEDs
   * 2 buttons
   * One RS232 parallel cable with DB9 connector(cable not included)
   * 4 channel A/D via I2C interface
   * Thermistor input via A/D

Standalone Demo
